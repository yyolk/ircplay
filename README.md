# ircplay

IRC log playback. Specific to one format example I've seen where I still use
IRC almost daily, twitch.tv chat.

## Why?

I have been slowly refactoring my own hypermedia experience with
twitch.tv.

This is in that vein.

Originally made to be used against the twitch-chat-downloader for `.irc`
output chat logs.

Currently using TheDrHax/Twich-Chat-Downloader fork which does currently work,
for now. See: https://github.com/TheDrHax/Twitch-Chat-Downloader.
